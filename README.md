## Brief:

Technical Requirements
Your app must:

Render a game board in the browser
Switch turns between X and O (or whichever markers you select); your game should prevent users from playing a turn into a square that is already occupied
Visually display which side won if a player gets three in a row or show a draw/"catâ€™s game" if neither wins
Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files
Stick with KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles
Use Javascript with jQuery for DOM manipulation
Deploy your game online, where the rest of the world can access it
Use semantic markup for HTML and CSS (adhere to best practices)
